# California Transportation Analysis
## What this project does
Analyzes 200,000+ rows of California commute data to find which transport modes are most popular and which demographic groups rely most on public transportation.
## Key Findings

Cars dominate commuting at 332 million trips — public transport accounts for only 20 million
Raw numbers suggest Latino and White groups are the biggest public transport users
But when adjusted for population size, African Americans rely on public transport the most — nearly 3x more than White population

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas
